# CS-599_Machine_Learning_Lab-2
Step 1: Download the spam.csv Download spam.csvFile
Start by downloading the spam.csv file, which contains the dataset you will be using for this task. Make sure to place the file in an easily accessible location on your machine or upload it directly to your Google Colab environment.

Step 2: Test Sklearn Algorithms
Next, follow this Colab linkLinks to an external site. to run the provided code. The Colab notebook will guide you through using Scikit-learn's algorithms to process the spam.csv dataset. Run the provided code blocks to test the performance of these algorithms.

Step 3: Implement Logistic Regression from Scratch
After testing the Scikit-learn implementations, your task is to implement the Logistic Regression classifier without using Scikit-learn or any other machine learning libraries. Your implementation should include the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Run code in the colab link.
Calculate Probabilities: Compute the prior probabilities of spam and non-spam classes, and calculate the likelihood of each feature given a class.
Prediction: Use the calculated probabilities to predict whether an email is spam or not.
Evaluation: Compare the performance of your  Logistic Regression implementation with the results obtained using Scikit-learn. Draw point graph with two lines.
